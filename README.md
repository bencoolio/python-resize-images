Python script to resize images with user input of a width. Script keeps ratio of image and automatically adjusts the height of the image.

Great for web designers working with lots of images needing to be the same width, such as product images, etc.

How to run:
python resize.py -d 'FULL PATH TO DIRECTORY WITH IMAGES' -w 200
